            <h1>What does "celibate" means?</h1>
            <p>
                A celibate is a person who practices celibacy . Celibacy is the state of abstaining from relationships (mainly sexual) . It is often seen being practiced by monks and nuns of many religions and tribes . But don't confuse being celibate with being religious, they are two <em>parallel</em> concepts.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article class="darkbg">
            <h1>
                The Reward ! ?
            </h1>
            <h3>Unnatural Focus and Efficiency.</h3>
            <p>
                Human body was <strong>not</strong> designed for celibacy . It was designed to carry out Sexual Intercourse so that the cycle of Replication process keep going on for the survival of the species . You might have heard that Sex is healthy for human body . It is true, but it does not mean that Celibacy is harmful.
            </p>
            <p>
                So by practicing celibacy, we are going against the very laws of nature . It is like a trade . The fuel produced in your body is used to provide you with Unnatural Focus and Efficiency levels because you denied to use it for  its natural purpose (Sex).
            </p>
            <p>
                Different types of celibactic conditions yield different proportions of these benefits.
            </p>
            <h3>More time than others</h3>
            <P>
                When you are more focused than other people , you are more efficient which means you can complete the same amount of work in less time . This provides you with more time to spare than other people, which you may use as you wish.
            </P>
            <p>
                Some celibactic conditions give you extra time too. 
                For example if you don't have a partner, you save up all the time which you would have spent on them, dating or otherwise.
            </p>
            <h3>More Physical energy</h3>
            <p>
                Being a Man myself, I can only speak for <strong>Males</strong> regarding this benefit . I am <strong>not</strong> saying that it is not valid for females.
            </p>
            <p>
                Male human body produces testosterone, that is responsible for physical energy levels . You might have heard the saying "Having sex is not good for Bodybuilding" . It is because the testosterone gets used up in sex, and the body have to produce more of it, in the meantime if you workout, your body simply does not have enough testosterone to recover your muscles, let alone make them stronger.
            </p>
            <p>
                While being a celibate, you save up all the testosterone that was being used in sex and hence you have high energy levels all day long . But be mindful to use it every once in a while, our body stops producing it if the stores are full. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember, <strong>Masturbation</strong> will have the same effect as sex in this case.

            <h1>Types of celibacy</h1>
            <p>Celibacy can be categorised on the following basis:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Time Period</strong> . Religious people like monks, priests and nuns often practice celibacy for life for spiritual purposes . Other practitioners specify a certain period of time for themseleves in which they remain celibate.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Depth</strong> . This means the level of restriant that one is applying on oneself . While most people practice extreme levels (not even allowing themselves to think about sexual activities), there are celibates like me who prefer a softer approach. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Situation</strong> . You might get surprised to know that celibacy can also be practiced while being in a relationship or even marriage! But again the more popular approach is by remaining uncommitted.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                These three factors listed above are the building blocks of every celibatic life . You can design your own versions of celibacy using them.
            </p>
        </article>
        <article class="darkbg">
            <h1>
                Designing your celibatic conditions.
            </h1>
            <P>
                Before you start practicing celibacy, you have to decide how you are going to approach it . You just have to keep the above listed factors in mind.
            </P>
            <p>
                Start with the <strong>Situation</strong> factor . If you are in a relationship or are married to someone, you have to inform them about it . You might have to break it up if the other person is not okay with your changing lifestyle . It will also help you decide the time period and the depth of your celibatic life. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Next comes the <strong>Depth</strong> factor . Decide how much restriant you are willing to put on yourself . You  definately can't have sex with someone, this is the only fixed rule in celibacy . But you can still kiss someone, hug them , cuddling, touching etc are all yours to decide or put aside . Masturbation is controversial here, but I personally think of it as a condition that one can set for himself, just like kissing . Remember <strong>higher restriant means better benefits</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Time Period</strong> should be decided last when you know what you Situation is and how deep you are willing to go . Think of it as the interest period on money, it keeps compounding over and over , the longer you practice it . My personal opinion would be to set a decent time period and practicing with absolute dedication in accordance with the rules that you set for yourself . You may extend it later if you like the results but don't shrunk it.
            </p>
            <h3>Some Examples</h3>
            <p>
                All the religious people like preists, monks and nuns practice extreme levels of celibacy that is Celibacy for life with full depth and remaining unmarried . They have taken vows of celibacy which specifies these condition.
            </p>
            <P>
                I for one have taken a self-committment of temporary celibacy . I was uncommitted when I started practicing and would prefer to remain so . I am willing to go to full depth . Although, to be honest, I must reveal that in my inital days, I masturbated a few times untill I finally adapted to this lifestyle . I have set a relative time period for myself, that is I will practice celibacy untill the time when my income is thrice as my expenses. This is the reason for full depth so I may achieve my goals in best possible time.
            </P>
            <p>
                A friend of mine is practicing celibacy until she gets a job . She is single but limiting her depth to only sex and kissing.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my acquaintance is practicing celibacy for a set period of 18 months . He has a girlfriend who is totally fine with his committment . He has restraint himself only to sex and Masturbation.
